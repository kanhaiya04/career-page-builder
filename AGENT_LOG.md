Primarily used AI for component generation and tech stack comparison. Asked "should I use Next.js or any other stack for this?" and it helped compare options before settling on Next.js + Prisma. For UI components, used prompts like "create a card component" and "build a badge component with variants" - most of the shadcn/ui components were generated this way. Also used it for schema design, asking things like "what fields should a Company table have?" and iterating until the Prisma schema made sense.
